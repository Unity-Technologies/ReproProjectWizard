# Repro Project Wizard #

Repro Project Wizard provides functionality to quickly create concise repro projects to share only the assets that demonstrate issues in a full project. The Repro Project Wizard simplifies the process to create small and easy to share reproduction projects.

If you submit a bug to Unity, it's best practice to use this package to generate a repro project.
